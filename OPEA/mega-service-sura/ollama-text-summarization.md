# Task 1: Analyzing Ollama Text Summarization Component

## Description

Analyze and implement Ollama as a text summarization service, documenting the structure and implementation details.

## Working Notes

I chose **Text Summarization using Llama2** to analyze and run it separately.

### Observations

Analyzing the Docker Compose Configuration:

1. All components are containerized using Docker
2. Service configuration is managed through environment variables
3. Network is configured using bridge mode for accessibility
4. Port mapping is configured for API access (8008:11434)
5. Support for proxy configuration is built-in
6. Model selection is flexible through environment variables

### Implementation Analysis

1. Initial Setup:

```yaml
services:
  ollama-server:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports:
      - 8008:11434
    environment:
      LLM_MODEL_ID: "llama2"
```

### Running the Service:

bashCopydocker compose up

### Downloading the Model:

```
bashCopycurl http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{
"model": "llama2"
}'
```

Testing Text Summarization:

```
bashCopycurl http://localhost:8008/api/generate -d '{
"model": "llama2",
"prompt": "Please summarize the following text: <insert text here>"
}'
```
Implementation Steps

Prerequisites

Docker installed
Basic understanding of REST APIs
Text data for summarization


Setup Steps:

bashCopy# Create docker-compose.yml
# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# Pull the model
curl http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{"model": "llama2"}'

Example Use Case

bashCopy# Example text summarization request
curl http://localhost:8008/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama2",
  "prompt": "Please summarize this text: The development of artificial intelligence has revolutionized many industries, from healthcare to transportation. AI systems can now perform complex tasks that once required human intervention. However, these advances also raise important ethical considerations about privacy and automation.",
  "stream": false
}'
